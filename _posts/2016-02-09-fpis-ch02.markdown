I decided to start learning Scala, again, after starting and stopping few times in the past. The main reason was because
something else came out, on my daily job or in something is was studying; moreover I often found the language not actually straightforward meaning you need to put quite an effort to master it.  
To do my study I decided to use the book "Functional Programming in Scala" of Paul Chiusano and RÃºnar Bjarnason. This book is actually not a book to how to program in Scala, for a novice, but instead is teaching how to learn functional programming, using Scala as the language for implement the exercises.

I'm going to talk about my experience by chapter of the book. Perhaps some of my implementation will result different of the one the authors propose on the [repository related to the book] [fpis-authors-repo] but the result must be the same.

On top of that, the project I create is using SBT as built tool and every exercise is written starting from a (Scala) test.

I completed the chapter two of the book, pretty basic exercises but very good to brush
