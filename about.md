My name is Matteo, I'm Italian and I'm a computer engineer.

I lived, studied and worked most of my life in Italy, but for  quite a while I was thinking of trying to live somewhere abroad.

So I decided to leave, for trying this kind of experience and I moved first to
England and then to Germany.

In my spare time I like to explore some languages/technologies.
