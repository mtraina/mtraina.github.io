I completed the chapter three of the book, pretty basic exercises but very good to brush up some important concepts of 
functional programming such as recursion, currying, function composition.

Pretty enjoyed it, interesting that Scala provides an annotation for a function that is tail recursive

```scala
def factorial(n: Int): Int = {
    @tailrec
    def go(n: Int, acc: Int): Int = {
      if(n <= 0) acc
      else go(n-1, n * acc)
    }
    go(n, 1)
  }
```

A function is tail recursive if is returning the result of the recursive call directly, without doing anything else.

It's important to say that if a function is annotated in this way and the compiler can't perform a tail call elimination
the compiler will give us an error.
