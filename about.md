My name's is Matteo, I'm Italian and I'm a computer engineer.

I lived, studied and worked most of my life in Italy, but since the time of the
university I was guessing how'd be living abroad.

So I decided to leave for trying this kind of experience and I moved first to
England and then to Germany.
